# Guidelines for creating community style guides

> this document is not ready for review. It is still a draft

This document provides step-by-step instructions for creating a community style guide. Community style guides are to be used in coordination with the [General Mozilla L10n Style Guide](mozilla_general/README.md) but provide additional information that is vital to producing a high-quality translation in the community locale.

Each heading in this document represents a common style topic in localization. Each topic features one or more questions that pertain to the information of the topic. Below each question is a description of how to answer the question and some examples of relevant information.

## How to use these guidelines

1. [Create a folder for your locale](make_new_folder.md) in the repository.
2. [Copy the style guide template](make_copy_template.md).
3. Fill out each section of the template, using the questions and directions from the guidelines below.
4. [Submit a pull request](make_pull_request.md) to the repository administrators.
5. [Request a review](make_review_request.md) of your style guide from another member of your community (if there are no other members of your community, include a note in your pull request).

If your community already has a style guide, you can follow these steps, using your style guide as a resource for relevant information, or you can use these guidelines to review and update your style guide.

As you follow these steps, only include information that is relevant to your locale. If you are using the style guide template, remove sections of the template that do not apply to your language or locale.

Once you have updated or create your community style guide, submit a pull request to the repository managers. Read the steps for submitting a pull request for your style guide [here](make_pull_request.md)

## Formality and Tone

**Who is the target user for this project and what is their background?**

Describe briefly the users from your locale. If the type of user from one project to another will vary, indicate so here.

**How would a target user for this project expect to interact with this project?**

Describe the type of interaction users from your locale expect. Interactions could range from authoritative and formal to friendly and casual. Indicate what kind of tone is preferred in your locale.

Describe the features that create the right tone. For example, Spanish has multiple forms of the second person pronoun `you`. Generally, `tu` is considered informal and personal and `usted` is considered formal and impersonal. Mozilla's Photon guidelines prefer an informal and personal interaction; however, if the culture of your locale prefers a formal interaction, that should be declared in your community style guide.

**Is formal language or informal language appropriate for all of your language's Mozilla l10n projects, or only some of them? Which ones?**

If the tone varies from project to project, indicate what tone is best for which projects.

## Natural expression

**What kind of expression sounds natural in your locale?**

Describe the features of a natural sounding localization.

**Does your locale allow for many borrowed words and phrases or few?**

List any important specific cases or include a link to any relevant resources. For example, the Spanish phrase, `En ocho d√≠as` could be translated as `in eight days`. However, a natural expression in English would be `in seven days` or even `in a week`. All three are correct translations, but the last two are more natural in English.

## Handling cultural references, idioms, and slang

Cultural references, idioms, and slang require a full understanding of these references between the cultures of your source and target languages. An example of a cultural reference in English would be the phrase, `kick-off meeting`. This is a reference that uses an American football term. It means a meeting to begin a project. To translate it, you can follow one of two approaches:

1. Find an equivalent reference phrase in your language.
2. Remove the cultural reference and translate the core meaning (e.g., `a commencement meeting`)

Define a policy for handling these cultural references, idioms, and slang that you can make standard across all projects. Consider resources you can refer back to in order to find cultural equivalents and list them in this section of your style guide (e.g., a slang dictionary in your language).

Translating terms representing difficult concepts is a tricky task. Here are some ideas to help you translate terms that do not have equivalents in your language:

* Understand the meaning of the term in English. Definitions of a few key terms [http://techterms.com/category/internet](http://techterms.com/category/internet)
* Know your product and understand the function of the feature.
* Consider similar ideas for those functions in your culture.
* Associate a culturally specific image with the meaning and function of the term.

## Units and Unit Conversion

Many elements of unit or grammar do not exist or apply to all languages. If you find one of these elements that does not apply to your language, please remove it from your style guide. For those definitions of units and grammar that apply document the reference used or how it will be applied to the translation.

The translation should strive to achieve proper unit conversions for currency, measurements, etc. for the target audience.

### Date Format

How are the date formats for weeks and months expressed in the following forms:

* 1). Fully spelled out 2). 2 or 3 letters  3). Single letter
* What is the order of Year, Month and Day?

Reference material can be find here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country)

### Calendar view:

* Which date is considered the first day of the week, Sunday or Monday?
* Is Lunar calendar observed?  Other regional calendar observed?

### Time Format

How is time expressed in your language? Including 0-24 hr expression, hour, minute and second.

### Numerals

How are numerals and percentages expressed in your language?

* Example: `1.23` (decimal separator) or 1,000 (thousand separator) using comma or period.

### Currency

What are other widely used currency and symbols used in your country/language for paid apps.

### Units

Do you use the imperial, metric or nautical system for measuring weight, distance, etc.? Source strings will use the imperial system (e.g., miles, pounds, feet, gallons, etc.). Target translations should convert imperial metrics to their measurement system.

### Names

What are the order of family name and given name in your language?  Here is the guideline on the naming convention from w3c.org:

### Address and Postal Code Format

What is the format in your language?

* Example: most Asian countries start from big to small: `[Country] [postal code][state/province][city][district][street number and name][building and suite numbers][addressee]`
* Countries of European languages start from small to big: `[addressee][street number and name][building and suite numbers][district][city][state/province][postal code][Country]`

### Telephone Number format

Space separators between digits can be different for area codes such as State (Province) and City,

## Grammar

### Spelling And Grammar Checks

Many languages have national or international standards that define spelling and grammar rules. When defining these rules for your community, make reference to those standards wherever possible. Do you have automated tests for spell checking and grammar? List those tools and dictionaries here and how regularly they should be used.

### Tense

Do you have standards for verb forms that indicate or express the time, such as past, present, or future, of the action or state? What is your policy on tense consistency for certain use cases? For example, for phrases that ask a user to make an action (like `Download Firefox`), do you use a future tense, a command tense, or a neutral tense?  (See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_tense) )

## Word Forms

### Pluralization

What is the appropriate form of expressing pluralization in your language?  List all forms of plural forms and examples if there is more than one.  Additional discussions can be found Here. [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_and_Plurals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_and_Plurals) and here:  [http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)

### Abbreviations

How are abbreviations expressed in your language?

* Example, in English, abbreviations are made by removing most vowels and only using the first 3-5 consonants followed by a period (e.g., `abbreviation` = `abbr`.).  (see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation))

If your language does not have a standard way of expressing abbreviations, do you simply leave them in English?

### Acronyms

Are there standard translations of widely accepted acronyms such as CD, DVD, MB in your language? If not, do they remain in English? (see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym))

### Punctuation

Do you use different punctuation rules in your Firefox localization than what your language standard defines?

* Example: do you use a period at the end of every user interface element translation or only some? What is the international/national standard for punctuation in your language?

### Emphasis

Is there an international/national standard for capitalization in your language?

* If so, do those standard rules apply in all product translations?
* If this doesn't apply, how do you indicate importance or name of a movie, book title, product UIs (`Save`, `File`...) in your language?
* How does your language handle the use of bold, italic, or underline types to express emphasis?  ( See: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_type) )

### Hyphens and compounds

What is the appropriate way of using hyphens and compounds in your language?  ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_%28linguistics%29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_%28linguistics%29))

### Prepositions and articles

What is the appropriate form of expressing prepositions and articles in your language?

### Diacritics and Special characters

Does your language use any special or accented characters and will they be applied and preserved in sort orders, and other aspects of the translation?  (see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic))

### Quotes

Does your language have a standard use for quotation marks, parenthesis, or brackets?

### Whitespace

Does your language require the use of white space around words, sentences, paragraphs, etc.? If so, in what ways?  (see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing_in_language_and_style_guides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing_in_language_and_style_guides))
